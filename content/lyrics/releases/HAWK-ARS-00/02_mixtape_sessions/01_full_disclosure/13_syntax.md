````m
So spastic - this dramatic climax applies rapid
Automatic graphic tactics with these death-defying antics
I designed just for practice - as my tongue provides the magic
For this Precise Syntax that I try to spit back at

My enemy's attacks - Lay 'em down in these tracks
Display my choreographed acts in this rap - its a fact
They can't win - cause I don't lack - anything but Tact
I leave them trapped when I snap - then I hack

Them to pieces - Tell Jesus that Thesis is the sleekest
Form of telekinesis you have found - There's no weakness
My brilliant Exegesis is in fact quite Ingenious
As my power level reaches new heights I think I'll keep this

Chip on my shoulder just in case they get bolder
This Bar will never lower, So I let their rage smolder
They lose their composure 'cause they cannot gain closure
I told you it gets colder - Here - I'll rhyme slower

Like a time-bomb ticking, I provide the right Image
For you chickens to keep skimming 'till you're sickened
No Limit to my Quick Pen, When I pick where to stick my dick in
All these privileged little bitches don't listen

This incantation's narration makes the devil start praying
My formation is a Creation meant to slay 'em
You don't want this damnation - It is not a vacation
His frustration brings elation - So I'm Waiting

No Craft can outmatch it - All these tragic asthmatics
Get sick when I spit this wicked shit - is traumatic
Flip the switch enigmatic when I'm pennin' problematic
Lunatic Scriptures that I designed with Black Magick

Too confident I guess but don't let yourself miss
An opportunity - your cartoon team - should not get it twisted
I'll harpoon your dreams and as you scream I'll wish I had to fuck to give
Now listen as I Spit this Thunder and be glad I let you live

Run and call the fucking cops
I'm saying shit to make it stop
Your heart I mean it just seems
Too weak to hear my language drop

Fear my lyrics when you hear it
Do not approach me if I'm near kids
Hold your ears 'til I'm clear
And make sure you're not shocked

When I circle back around
To make sure your defense is down
Don't make me play this fuckin' sound
You'll disappear and not be found

I told you motherfucking clowns I'm creeping through this fucking town
To see you think I'm bluffing - now you're trusting I won't bust it out
If I do - I hope you're ready - haunt your nightmares like Freddy
Crucify your self-esteem - in every line my laser beams - cut you off now hold steady

Musical mercenary
The truth's heavy and you're scared
You can never
Be prepared for me
````
